# Default AWS configuration (can be pointed to actual AWS)
aws.region=us-east-1
# The endpoint-url is intentionally left blank.
# For production, you might not set this, and the SDK will use the default AWS endpoint.
# For local development against LocalStack, you would set it, e.g., aws.s3.endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566
aws.endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566
